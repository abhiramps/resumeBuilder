# All Date Selects Fixed - Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully fixed date selection dropdowns in **all** editor components. Date selects now show selected values immediately and work smoothly for both new and existing entries.

## Problem
When adding new entries (experience, projects, education, certifications), the date dropdowns would not display the selected month or year. After selecting "January", the dropdown would still show "Month" placeholder instead of "January".

## Root Cause
We were storing dates as a single string (e.g., "2024-01") and only updating when both month AND year were selected. This meant:
- User selects month → onChange fires → but date string doesn't update (waiting for year)
- Select component value doesn't change → still shows placeholder
- User sees no feedback that their selection was registered

## Solution Applied to All Editors
Track month and year selections separately in local state:

```typescript
// Separate state for each date part
const [startMonth, setStartMonth] = useState<string | undefined>(undefined);
const [startYear, setStartYear] = useState<string | undefined>(undefined);
const [endMonth, setEndMonth] = useState<string | undefined>(undefined);
const [endYear, setEndYear] = useState<string | undefined>(undefined);

// Initialize from props when switching entries
useEffect(() => {
  const [sYear, sMonth] = entry.startDate ? entry.startDate.split("-") : [undefined, undefined];
  setStartMonth(sMonth);
  setStartYear(sYear);
  // ... same for end date
}, [entry.id]);

// Update immediately when user selects
const handleDateUpdate = (field, month, year) => {
  if (field === "startDate") {
    if (month !== undefined) setStartMonth(month);  // ← Instant update
    if (year !== undefined) setStartYear(year);      // ← Instant update
    
    // Only save to parent when both are selected
    const finalMonth = month !== undefined ? month : startMonth;
    const finalYear = year !== undefined ? year : startYear;
    
    if (finalMonth && finalYear) {
      handleFieldUpdate(field, `${finalYear}-${finalMonth}`);
    }
  }
};

// Use separate state for display
const startDate = { month: startMonth, year: startYear };
```

## How It Works Now

### User Experience:
1. **Add new entry** → Date dropdowns show "Month" and "Year" placeholders ✅
2. **Click Start Month** → Dropdown opens with all months ✅
3. **Select "January"** → Dropdown immediately shows "January" ✅
4. **Click Start Year** → Dropdown opens with years ✅
5. **Select "2024"** → Dropdown immediately shows "2024" ✅

Shows "January" to user ✅
  ↓
User selects year
  ↓
setStartYear("2024") - instant local state update
  ↓
Select component re-renders with value="2024"
  ↓
Shows "2024" to user ✅
  ↓
Both month and year present
  ↓
handleFieldUpdate("startDate", "2024-01") - debounced
  ↓
Parent state updates after 300ms
  ↓
Preview updates smoothly
```
