# Requirements Document - Resume Templates

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing four distinct resume templates for the ATS Resume Builder application. Each template must maintain ATS compliance while providing unique visual styles to suit different industries and user preferences.

## Glossary

- **ATS (Applicant Tracking System)**: Software used by employers to parse and rank resumes
- **Template**: A pre-designed resume layout with specific styling and structure
- **TemplateBase**: The foundational component that all templates extend
- **Print Mode**: Rendering mode optimized for PDF generation and printing
- **Layout Settings**: User-customizable settings for margins, fonts, colors, and spacing
