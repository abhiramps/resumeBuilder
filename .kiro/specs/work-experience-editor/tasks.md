## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Start with basic component structure and gradually add features
- Implement core CRUD operations before advanced features like drag-and-drop
- Test each feature thoroughly before moving to the next
- Follow established patterns from PersonalInfoEditor and SummaryEditor

### Code Quality Standards
- Use TypeScript strictly with proper interface definitions
- Follow existing component patterns and naming conventions
- Implement comprehensive error handling and validation
- Maintain consistent code formatting and documentation

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests alongside implementation, not after
- Focus on user workflows and edge cases
- Test accessibility features thoroughly
- Validate ATS compliance in all scenarios

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize for handling up to 20 experience entries
- Implement efficient re-rendering strategies
- Use debounced updates to prevent excessive API calls
- Consider virtual scrolling for large lists

### Accessibility Requirements
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Proper focus management
- ARIA labels and descriptions for all interactive elements
