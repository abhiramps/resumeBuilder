## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Start with basic category management and gradually add features
- Implement skill tag input as a reusable component
- Build comprehensive suggestion system with efficient filtering
- Test each feature thoroughly before moving to the next

### Code Quality Standards
- Use TypeScript strictly with proper interface definitions
- Follow established patterns from previous editor components
- Implement comprehensive error handling and validation
- Maintain consistent code formatting and documentation

### Skill Management Strategy
- Create intuitive tag-based interface for skill input
- Implement smart suggestions with category awareness
- Support both predefined and custom skills
- Ensure ATS-friendly formatting for all skills

### Category Management
- Provide standard categories with customization options
- Support category templates for quick setup
- Allow flexible category organization
- Maintain category consistency across resume

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests alongside implementation
- Focus on user workflows and edge cases
- Test suggestion system thoroughly
- Validate category and skill management operations

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize for handling up to 50 skills across 10 categories
- Implement efficient suggestion filtering
- Use debounced updates to prevent excessive API calls
- Consider virtual scrolling for large skill lists

### Accessibility Requirements
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility for tag management
- Proper focus management during dynamic changes
- ARIA labels for all skill and category operations
